# **File Sharing Website â€” UIT Share**
*for University of Information Technology - VNUHCM (UIT) students*

---

Hi, I'm a student at UIT and this is a ***Web application programming*** course project that my teacher assign to me.

This project is a document sharing website for UIT students *(or any University students that learn about information technology)* to view and download files *(such as Lectures/Slides, Labs, Exercises, Books)* of specific courses *(e.g. Object-Oriented Programming course, Data Structures & Algorithms course,...)*.

<br>

Technologies that I used in the project are [**Django**](https://www.djangoproject.com/) *(version 4.1)*, [**PostgreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org/), [**Bootstrap**](https://getbootstrap.com/) *(version 5.2.2)*, a little bit of [**jQuery**](https://jquery.com/), and [**AWS S3**](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for file storage.

You can check file **requirements.txt** for dependencies of the project.
